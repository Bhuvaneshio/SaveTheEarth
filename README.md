# SaveTheEarth
Spider Task v1.0
The Strongest Avenger - THOR
I, Son of Odin, am one of the saviour of the Earth whenever there is a calamity happening..
Now after Ragnarok, I have decided the Earth as the NewAsgard
Therefore, This is to prove that Thor will always have the Asgard's back..!

Fortunately, I am Mighty!
The price of freedom is high, it always has been.
And it's a price I'm willing to pay.  And if I'm the only one, then so be it.
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.
Don't look back You are not going that way.

We are Avengers...!!!!
